The Legacy Modding wiki aims to be a comprehensive resource about creating mods for old versions of Minecraft. Currently it mainly focuses on Forge mod development for 1.7.10.

## Contributing

It's possible to contribute by simply editing the markdown files in the `docs` directory. However, to test changes, it may be desirable to set up a local mkdocs server:

```
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-windmill
mkdocs serve
```

The wiki will be browsable at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) with live reloading.
