# Forge Workspace Setup

## Obtaining the MDK

The official Forge MDK (Modding Development Kit) is available at [Forge's website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/). However, MDKs for legacy versions no longer function out of the box. Therefore it's recommended to start from one of the following modern template projects instead.

(For the curious, a guide to fixing up the old build script can be found [here](troubleshooting-1.7.10-build-scripts.md))

### Template projects

For more info about each Gradle plugin, refer to [Gradle Plugins](gradle-plugins.md).
